**SkinGenBot** is a minecraft skin generator which is both a discord bot and console app.
On startup, you can choose whether you want it to run in console mode or bot mode.

**Console Mode**:
- Saves skin files to the directory the exe is located in
- Can generate both custom and random skin files

**Bot Mode**:
- Does not save skin files to your device
- Can generate both custom and random skin files
- Requires setup with bot token on first run of the exe
- Uses "?skin (hex code)" and "?random"

**Build Dependencies**:
- Requires the "BaseSkin.png" file to be an 'EmbeddedResource'
- Uses DisCatSharp (https://github.com/Aiko-IT-Systems/DisCatSharp)
